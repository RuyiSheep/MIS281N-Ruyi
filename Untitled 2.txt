I was most interested in the project that combined data science techniques with data engineering skills to build a data lake and an orchestration framework. While I have prior experience with SQL and Python, orchestration was new to me. I also found it valuable to learn how distributed computing works in PySpark and how shuffle can be reduced at scale. Overall, my main interest lies in orchestration, data workflow logic, and real-time analytics.
